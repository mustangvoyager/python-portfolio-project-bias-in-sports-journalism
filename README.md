# python-portfolio-project-bias-in-sports-journalism

The purpose of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis and create several data visualizations for a dataset chosen by me. The dataset I chose was a lexical breakdown of a thousand sports articles from the 2011-2013 time period. The dataset was found in the UCI repository. The articles encompass a variety of sport topics; all of them were originally posted on the internet.

I created a Jupyter Notebook (version: 7.3.2) containing Python code and utilizing the pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and NumPy libraries. I also made a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michael.healy2807/vizzes) that highlights just a few of the data vizzez found here.

My purpose in creating and posting this is to further master my skills using a variety of data science tools, and to complete a final portfolio project for the Business Intelligence Data Analsyt career path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/subject/data-science). I appreciate the constructive feedback provided by the Codecademy community of learners, and I invite the reader's input as well.
